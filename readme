Install the appropriate packages and run in the folder you downloaded the files

nasm -felf64 ./snak.asm && ld snak.o -o ./snak

to compile the assembly files



Then run 'snak' from the terminal and you're good to go
WASD for movement
Exit at any time with 'q'


It works in Ubuntu, not sure about other devices
